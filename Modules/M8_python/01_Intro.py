# what is Python?

# Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido can Rossum,
# and released in 1991

# It is used for:
# Web development (server-side),
# software development,
# mathematics,
# system scripting

# python was designed for readability
# and has some similarities to the English language with
# influence from mathematics

# Python uses new lines to complete a command,
# as opposed to other programming languages which often
# use semicolons or parentheses.

# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace,
# to define scope; such as the scope of loops,
# functions and classes. Other porgramming languages
# Often use curly brackets for this purpose
