<!--
    The real pwer of PHP comes from its functions. PHP has more than 1000 builtin functions
    See: http://php.net/manual/en/indexes.functions.php for a full listing
    *************************************
    PHP User Defined Functions

    Besides the built in PHP funtions, we can create our own functions.

    A function is a block statements that can be used repeatedly in a program

    A function will no execute immediately when a page loads

    A function will be executed by a call to the function

    A function name can start with a letter or underscore (not a number)

    Function names are NOT case-sensitive

    Tip: Give the function a name that reflects what the function does!
    ****************************
    PHP Function arguments
    Information can be passed to functions through arguments. An argument
    is just like a variable

    Arguments are specified after the funtion name, inside parantheses
    You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma

    **************************
    PHP default argument value

    arguments can be specified with a default parameter
    *************************
    PHP functions - returning values
    To let a function return a value , use the return statement
