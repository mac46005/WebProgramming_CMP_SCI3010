        <p>Conan's Father said: <q>For no one - no one in this world can you trust.
            Not men, not women, not beasts. This you can trust.</q><i>[points to sword]</i></p>
        
            <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb..com/title/tt0082198/quotes">
                Crom, I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it.
                No one, not even you, will remember if we were good men or bad.
                Why we fought, or why we died. All that matters is that two stood against many.
                That's what's important! Valor pleases you, Crom... so grant me one request.
                Grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then HELL with you!
