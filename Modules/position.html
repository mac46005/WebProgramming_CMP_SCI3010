    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

    There are four different position values:
    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute

    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first.
    They also work differently depending on the position value.

    position: static;
    HTML elements are positioned static by default.
    Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left,
    and right propertied.
    An element with postion: static; is not positioned in any special way;
    it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

    position: relative;
    An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
    Setting the top, right, bottom, and left propertied of a relatively-positioned
    element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content
    will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
