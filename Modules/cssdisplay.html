    The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.
    The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

    Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element
    it is. The default value for most elements is block or inline.

    A block level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width
    available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

    An inline element does not start on a new line and only take up as much
    width as necessary.

    Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none.
    The element will be hidden, and the page will be difplayed as if the
     element is not there.

     visibility:hidden; also hides an element.

     However, the element will still take up the same space as before.
     The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout.
