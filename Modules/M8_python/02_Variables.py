"""
Unlike other programming languages,
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type
and can even change type after they have been set.

"""
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha numeric characters
and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
Variable names are case sensitive ( age,Age,and AGE are three different variables)
