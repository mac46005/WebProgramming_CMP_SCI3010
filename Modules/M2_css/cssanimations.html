    CSS animations allows animations of most HTML elements without using Javascript or flash

    An Animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

    You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.

    To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

    Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
