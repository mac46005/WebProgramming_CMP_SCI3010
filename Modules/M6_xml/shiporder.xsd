    XML prolog, it must come first in the document

    There are tow current versions of XML. The first (XML) was initially
    defined in 1998. The second (XML 1.1) was initially published on
    Feruary 4, 2004. The main changes are to enable the use of line-ending
    characters used on EBDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code)
    platforms, and the use of scripts and characters absent from Unicode 32.
    XML 1.1 is not very widely implemented and is recommended for use only 
    by those who need its unique features.

    UTF-8 is the defualt character encoding for XML documents
    UTF-8 is also the default encoding for HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL.
