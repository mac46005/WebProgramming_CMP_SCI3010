    <!--
        CSS animation allows animations of most HTML elements using JS and Flash

        An animation lets an element change from one style to another.

        You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
        To use CSS animations, you must specify some keyframes for the animation.
        Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
